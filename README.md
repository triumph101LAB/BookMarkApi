This is my officail first API Project and personal backend project that I built using NestJs as the framework, typeScript and MongoDB as the database.
## Tools
- NestJs
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Thundercleint(For testing The endpoints)
- MongoDb for the dataBase
- npm as the package manager

## Breif Overview
- It allows to carry out basic CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
-  Using this Api you  bookmark containing the the title, author and the description of the Book
-  The user has to first fill in their deltails(username and passowrd)
-  They user is also given the leverage to carry out CRUD operations on the book properties except from the author property
